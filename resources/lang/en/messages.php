One cause of cognitive distortions is that we form our own worldview based on what we experience, hear, see, and feel. Therefore, we tend to have difficulty accepting information, opinions, and experiences from others that contradict the worldview we already have. We may also incorporate our own emotions, preferences, and biases into the thought processes we use to understand things. Thus, our emotional judgments and prejudices may prevent us from seeing things objectively. Furthermore, because we have finite knowledge and skills of our own, we may be influenced by lack of knowledge or missing information when we understand things. These can lead to cognitive distortions.',
