    'cognitive_distortion_title' => 'What is cognitive distortion?',
    'cognitive_distortion_description' => 'In cognitive behavioral therapy, "cognitive distortions" refer to unconscious repetition of inappropriate ways of thinking. These distortions usually cause psychological stress and anxiety. For example, a distortion called "catastrophic thinking" tends to imagine a bad future that is not true. Another distortion called "secondary information processing" tends to unconsciously interpret things in a bad way. Cognitive-behavioral therapy aims to detect and correct these distortions in order to restore psychological health.',

    'cognitive_distortion_cause_title' => 'The Causes of Cognitive Distortions',
    'cognitive_distortion_cause' => 'There are multiple causes of "cognitive distortions." One of them is negative memories and traumas from the past. People may tend to interpret themselves, others, and things in a negative way, especially when they have had negative experiences. Stress and anxiety can also cause people to view themselves and their surroundings as yellow. In addition, the way the brain processes experiences and information can also cause cognitive distortions. For example, the brain naturally tends to have an optimistic interpretation of events, so when something bad happens, it can lead to an optimistic view of it. These are the causes of "cognitive distortions".',
